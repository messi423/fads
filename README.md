Flow :)

1.	Added Authentication using react-redux and stored token in localStorage after successful authentication.
		
		
2. 	Made routes for different things
		* 	All Advertisements
		*	  Self Created Advertisements
		* 	Advertisements Details
		
3.	All routes:
		1. localhost:3000/login			                        
		2. localhost:3000/signup			              
		3. localhost:3000/					                        
		4. localhost:3000/profile			                    
		5. localhost:3000/ads/:adId		

4. profile where self created advertisents reside where we can edit/delete them
	
5. 	While accesing title and body in ad-details I faced an error due to which I was unable to move forward and 
	implement editing and adding comments from frontend!
  >however backend is functional where you can add comments on ads after getting yourself authorized. :)
